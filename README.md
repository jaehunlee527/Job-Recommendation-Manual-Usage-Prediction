# Job Care Manual Usage Classification
## Competition Summary
[Korea Employment Information Service](http://www.keis.or.kr) currently operates an AI platform that analyzes potential employees' traits and provides them with proper trainings, consultings and support. The organization hosted an open competition on [DACON(AI Hackathon Platform)](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235863/overview/description), where participants are expected to build classification models that predict whether people accessing their platform would decide to use the educational materials. The competition is part of their effort to eventually develop an individualized contents recommender system.
