# Job Care Manual Usage Classification

Korea Employment Information Service[http://www.keis.or.kr] currently operates an AI platform that analyzes potential employees' traits and provides them with proper trainings, consultings and support. The organization hosted an open competition on DACON(AI Hackathon Platform), where participants are expected to build classification models that predict whether people accessing their platform would eventually use the educational materials. In doing so, KEIS aims to develop an individualized contents recommender system.
